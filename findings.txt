Summarise your findings here (see specification).
To determine the difficulty of each of the boards, I consider how many
times the recursive functiion solve_board(board) has to be called and
also how many times the function makes a mistake and has to backtrack. The
latter former also includes the number of times another empty spot has
to be found and hence takes into account how empty the board was at the
start. It is important to note that the difficulty would probably be
different for a human who solves the board using a different
algorithm; however, the 'depth' and 'backtrack_count' variables should
indicate the difficulty of the boards for a computer using this
backtracking algortihm (difficulty being
relative to the other boards).

To track the number of times the 'solve_board(board) function is
called, a static integer 'depth' is added at the start of the 'solve_board(board)' function. It is
incremented every time the function is called and printed out on the
screen (this is is now commented-out in the function definition):

	    static int depth =0;
  	    depth++;
  	    cout<< "depth = " << depth <<endl;

Similarly, the static integer 'backtrack_count' is incremented
every time the solve_board(board) function was unsuccessful at
'guessing' a certain digit and has to backtrack and assign '.' to the
position. The following is added after the position is set back to
'.':
	 backtrack_count++;
	 cout<< backtrack_count<<endl;

However, it is important to only solve one board at a time, otherwise
depth will be cummulative.

HARD DIFFICULTY
This is mystery3.dat. The value of the depth integer is 14134 once
the board has been solved. This means the function was called 14134
times in order to solve the board.


EXTREMELY HARD DIFFICULTY
This is mystery1.dat. The value of the depth integer is 421547 by the
time the board is solved. As this value is larger than for the hard
board mystery3.dat, it means mystery1.dat is extremely hard.


IMPOSSIBLE TO SOLVE
This is mystery2.dat. The 'solve_board(board)' function returns false
for this board.

These findings are consistent with values of 'depth' for the easy.dat
and medium.dat boards. The board easy.dat has a depth value of 2172
and the medium.dat board has a depth value of 15662.
